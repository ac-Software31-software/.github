## 🧩 Overview  

Amphetamine for macOS is a lightweight yet powerful utility designed to keep your Mac awake and prevent it from going to sleep automatically. Whether you’re rendering a long video, downloading large files, or monitoring background tasks, Amphetamine ensures your system stays active exactly when you need it.  

The app gives users precise control over macOS’s power management, allowing them to customize sleep settings on a per-session basis. You can keep your Mac awake indefinitely, for a set duration, or only while specific apps are running. It’s perfect for developers, media creators, and anyone who needs uninterrupted performance during long-running tasks.  

Amphetamine’s interface is intuitive and minimal, residing conveniently in your menu bar. With a single click, you can activate a session or configure triggers that automatically keep your Mac awake under specific conditions. The app also integrates system notifications and optional scripts for advanced automation, giving you deeper control over how your machine behaves during active sessions.  

Optimized for macOS, Amphetamine consumes minimal resources and supports Apple Silicon for enhanced stability and performance. It’s a must-have utility for professionals who rely on consistent uptime and performance — whether for development, downloads, streaming, or presentations.
